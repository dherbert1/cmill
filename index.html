    <h2>How to</h2>
    <p>To adopt a dog from our shelter, there's paperwork and tests you need to take to confirm your qualifications 
        and your level of responsibility. Dogs are not just pets but apart of your family. Their lives matter just as much as
    any other living things life does.</p>

    <h2>Test</h2>
    <p>Our test will be sent to our employees, who will review your answers. Depending on your rating,
        you will be notified if you can take the dog home with you or not. Going to the test page will
        allow you to access the short test.
