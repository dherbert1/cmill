    <h2>Welcome to Sunny Days Dog Shelter website, where you can find anything you need to know about us!</h2>

        <h2>How to Adopt</h2>
        <p>To adopt a dog from our shelter, there's paperwork and tests you need to take to confirm your qualifications
            and your level of responsibility. Dogs are not just pets but apart of your family. Their lives matter just
            as much as
            any other living things life does.</p>

        <h2>Test</h2>
        <p>Our test will be sent to our employees, who will review your answers. Depending on your rating,
            you will be notified if you can take the dog home with you or not. Going to the test page will
            allow you to access the short test.
